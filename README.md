This project is created for **practice purposes** using the **Movies Database** in **MySQL RDBMS**.  
The task was to help a **Business Manager** find the **Revenue of all movies along with their titles** by working with two related tables.

The Business Manager wants:
- A list of **movie titles** with their **revenue**.  
- Data should be extracted by combining the `movies` table and the `financials` table from the database.  
- Queries must include the use of `JOIN`, `CASE`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to solve the requirement.
